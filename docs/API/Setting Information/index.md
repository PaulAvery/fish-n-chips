# Setting Information
Several methods are defined to set information which can then be output in structured form.

You could also set variables to achieve the same effect, but to allow the entrypoint to your application to look fairly structured, I chose to define methods to allow the following:

```fish
name        sample
version     1.0.0
author      Florian Albertz

```
